## Overview

I'd really appreciate any comments, tips and ways to improve! I'm still learning to use async await for the fetch. When I click repeatedly, it takes a time, sometimes even requiring two clicks to fetch again. How could I make it work better? I'd love to learn that.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap 5 for responsiveness

### What I learned

I've learned to create a "glow effect" and practiced a bit the use of async await for the fecth.

### Continued development

I need to practice and understand better the async part.

### Useful resources

- [Superdevresources](https://superdevresources.com/css-button-glow-effect//) - Very heplful for the glow effect.
- [Stackoverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - As always, helped me with a lot of things
